      <p>
        Operatives with the FLY keyword ignore vertical distances when moving on and over terrain
        features, meaning they do not need to climb or traverse and can move freely across gaps
        instead of jumping. In addition, when they drop, their intended location can be any vertical
        distance and the vertical distance they travel does not count towards the total distance
        they move.
