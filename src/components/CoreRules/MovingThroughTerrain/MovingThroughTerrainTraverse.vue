    <h4>Traverse</h4>
    <p>
      A traverse is when an operative must clear a small obstacle in their way such as a barricade
      or pipe. During an operativeâ€™s move, it can ascend and descend terrain with the Traversable
      trait at a cost of <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" />, but cannot finish a move on top of it.
      If this is not possible, it cannot traverse it - it must move around it instead. Note that a
      traverse is not a climb - the operative simply vaults over the obstacle in their way as it
      moves horizontally across the killzone.

    <p>
      The operative has a M characteristic of <InchIcons :count="3" :value="2" />.
      <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" /> of its M characteristic must be used to cross the
      Traversable terrain feature, meaning the operative can move a total of
      <InchIcons :count="2" :value="2" />.
