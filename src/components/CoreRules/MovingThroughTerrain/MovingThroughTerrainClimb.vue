    <h4>Climb</h4>
    <p>
      A climb is when an operative ascends or descends a terrain feature that it cannot traverse
      across during a move. First, the operative must be within
      <InchIcons :count="1" :value="1" /> of a physical and climbable part of a terrain feature to
      climb it - a wall, pipe, chain etc. The operative can then climb that terrain feature,
      counting the distance it travels towards the total distance it moves, rounding up any
      incremental distances of less than <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" /> to
      <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that an operative must finish a move in a location it can be placed. If this is not
      possible, such as if an operative does not have a high enough Movement characteristic to reach
      its intended destination, it cannot begin the climb. This means an operative cannot finish a
      move partway through a climb. An operative can, however, perform a Dash action during a climb
      in order to reach its intended destination.

          <li>
            It then climbs the terrain feature. It must move a vertical distance of more than
            <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" /> but less than <InchIcons :count="2" :value="2" />.
            As increments are rounded up, it moves
            <InchIcons :count="2" :value="2" />
            vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            To reach a location it can be placed, it must also move horizontally. The operative has
            <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" /> of its M characteristic remaining, allowing it to
            move onto the next level. You could then move the operative the full
            <InchIcons :count="1" :value="2" /> distance onto the level.

          <li>
            If the operative has any action points remaining, however, it could perform a Dash
            action to complete the climb, so long as it hasnâ€™t already performed a Dash action
            during its activation.
