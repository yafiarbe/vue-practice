A matched play game is then completed by following the sequence below: </p><h3 class="indent-0 !text-start" data-v-75eefe55>1. determine mission and map</h3><p data-v-75eefe55>Determine the mission and map. Here you will find a variety of methods to do this:</p><h4 data-v-75eefe55>organised</h4><p data-v-75eefe55> Specify beforehand which combination of mission and map will be used e.g. Loot+Strait (A4) or Secure+Junction (B7), etc. If a series of games are being played (e.g. at a tournament), each round can be specified beforehand. Alternatively, each subsequent round can be determined by the organiser beforehand, but only revealed after the previous round has been completed. </p><h4 data-v-75eefe55>random</h4><p data-v-75eefe55> Shuffle the mission cards and map cards separately, then deal one of each to randomly determine the mission and map. </p><h4 data-v-75eefe55>veto</h4><p data-v-75eefe55> The players roll off to decide Attacker and Defender first. The Attacker takes the mission cards and the Defender takes the map cards. </p><p data-v-75eefe55> The Attacker chooses two mission cards to put forward. The Defender selects one of them to use. </p><p data-v-75eefe55> The Defender chooses three map cards to put forward. The Attacker selects one of them to be discarded. The Defender selects one of the remaining cards to use. </p><p data-v-75eefe55> The Defender selects their drop zone after setting up the objective markers and killzone as normal. </p><h4 data-v-75eefe55>control</h4><p data-v-75eefe55> If the players are playing a series of games against each other, the winner of the previous game selects one of the mission cards that was not used in the previous battle. </p><p data-v-75eefe55> They then select one of the map types (i.e. 1-3, 4-6 or 7-9) that was not used in the previous battle, and the loser selects one of the map cards from that type. </p><h4 data-v-75eefe55>bid</h4><p data-v-75eefe55>Each player collects 10 tokens they will use to bid on the following categories:</p><ul class="ml-4 list-disc" data-v-75eefe55><li data-v-75eefe55>Mission</li><li data-v-75eefe55>Map</li><li data-v-75eefe55>Attacker and Defender (instead of rolling off)</li><li data-v-75eefe55>First initiative (instead of selections in the Scouting step)</li></ul><p data-v-75eefe55> Working through each category, each player will secretly put any of their tokens into their hand as their bid (or zero if they wish), then reveal their bid simultaneously. The player that bids the most will decide that category from all available options. If itâ€™s a draw, that bid is cancelled and the players bid again, unless they both bid zero, in which case the players roll off to determine that category. Once the category is resolved, both players discard their bid tokens. </p><p data-v-75eefe55> For example, in the map category, if one player bids 2 tokens and another bids 4, the latter would decide which map card to use. Both players would discard those tokens, then repeat this process for determining who decides Attacker and Defender. </p></section><section id="close-quarters" data-v-75eefe55>Crit Ops 2022: Close Quarters</section><section id="hazardous-areas" data-v-75eefe55>Approved Ops 2023: Hazardous Areas</section><section id="mission-generator" data-v-75eefe55>Mission Generator</section><section id="card-decks" data-v-75eefe55>Card Decks</section>',8),r=[d];function n(c,h){return t(),a("div",i,r)}const f=e(o,[["render",n],["__scopeId","data-v-75eefe55"]]);export{f as default};
