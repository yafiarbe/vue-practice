They will also need their miniatures’ accompanying rules, known as a faction army list, which can be found in various Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team publications. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> You will also need a set of combat gauges, a killzone and some dice. You may also find it helpful to have tokens to use when your miniatures have acted, taken wounds or performed certain special actions during the game. </p><section id="operatives-and-kill-teams" data-v-f55dccc0><h3 data-v-f55dccc0>operatives and kill teams</h3><p data-v-f55dccc0> The Citadel miniatures that a player uses in Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team are known as operatives. Your operatives are known as ‘friendly’ operatives and your opponent’s operatives are known as ‘enemy’ operatives. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> When you select your operatives for a battle, you are not selecting individuals, but rather a specialist squad that works together. This is known as your Kill Team. A list of the Kill Teams available to you can be found in your faction’s army list. In battle, all your friendly operatives are collectively referred to as your Kill Team. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Once you have selected your way to play, its mission sequence will tell you when you must select a Kill Team for a battle. When you do, you must select one of the Kill Teams from your faction’s army list, then select the operatives as specified by that Kill Team. Some Kill Teams will specify the exact configuration of operatives it consists of. Others will allow you to select your own configuration of operatives (with restrictions). In either case, the final configuration of operatives must conform to the requirements laid out by that Kill Team. </p></section><section id="distances" data-v-f55dccc0><h3 data-v-f55dccc0>distances</h3><p data-v-f55dccc0> Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team captures the tactical engagement of elite operatives by using a collection of combat gauges listed below to measure distances. Similarly, the tense and timely actions of operatives is often displayed in increments. Players can use a tape measure or other measuring device if they wish by converting the relevant distance below into inches, however the game is designed for and explained with graded distances. </p><ul data-v-f55dccc0><li data-v-f55dccc0>The triangle distance is 1&quot;.</li><li data-v-f55dccc0>The circle is 2&quot;.</li><li data-v-f55dccc0>The square is 3&quot;.</li><li data-v-f55dccc0>The pentagon is 6&quot;.</li></ul><p data-v-f55dccc0> Any distances of a symbol without a numerical value correspond to one combat gauge, e.g. . Multiple combat gauge distances will be specified with a numerical value, e.g. 2. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Distances can be measured at any time, and can be measured out in different increments, so long as the total does not exceed the specified distance. For example, if an operative is going to be moved a distance of 3. This can be measured out as , 6, or even . </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Many rules, such as a Normal Move or ability, will have a distance requirement. When measuring distances to and from operatives, measure from the closest part of the bases of operatives, rather than the miniature. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> If a rule states that something must be ‘within’ a certain range, it is in range if the closest part of its base is no more than the specified distance. If a rule states something must be ‘wholly within’ a certain range, it is in range if every part of its base is no more than the specified distance. An operative is always within and wholly within range of itself. </p></section><section id="killzon" data-v-f55dccc0><h3 data-v-f55dccc0>killzones</h3><p data-v-f55dccc0> A killzone is the playing area in which your operatives wage war. Games of Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team are designed to be played on a 30&quot; by 22&quot; area, which is the size of a kill team gameboard. A killzone will also contain various terrain features that add excitement and tactical depth to your games. Terrain is explained in more detail <a href="#" data-v-f55dccc0>here</a>. </p></section><section id="dice" data-v-f55dccc0><h3 data-v-f55dccc0>DICE</h3><p data-v-f55dccc0> Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team uses six-sided dice (D6). Rolling a dice will give you a value, known as the result, which will determine the success or failure of your operatives’ deeds. Some rules refer to a D3. In such cases, roll one D6 and halve the value (rounding fractions up) to determine the result. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Many rules require a certain result to succeed, such as attacking. For example, to make a successful roll, you might need a 3+. This means the result must be three or higher to succeed, so a dice roll value of 3, 4, 5 or 6 succeeds, whereas a dice roll value of 1 or 2 fails. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll. You can never re-roll a dice more than once, and you cannot select the original result, even if the new result is worse. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Some rules instruct players to roll off. To do so, both players roll one D6, and whoever scores highest wins the roll-off. If there is a tie for the highest roll, make the roll-off again. If both players would use a rule that would allow them to re-roll their dice when rolling off, both players must declare the use of this rule before any dice are re-rolled, starting with the player who lost the roll off. </p><p data-v-f55dccc0> Some rare rules will modify the result of a roll by adding or subtracting from the result. All modifiers are cumulative. A dice result can be modified above or below the maximum or minimum possible value of the roll. For example, if a D6 value is 6 and you must add 1 to the result, the final result is a 7. </p></section></article><article id="#datacards" data-v-f55dccc0><h2 data-v-f55dccc0>datacards</h2><p data-v-f55dccc0> Each operative in your Kill Team has its own set of individual rules known as a datacard. It states all the key characteristics of your operatives and the weapons they are equipped with, and details anything unique they can do. You will find an example datacard and details of what information it provides below. All of the terms below are then explained in this section. </p><img src="#" alt="Image Datacards" data-v-f55dccc0><section id="operative-type" data-v-f55dccc0><h3 data-v-f55dccc0>1. operative type</h3><p data-v-f55dccc0>The type of the operative.</p></section><section id="physical-profile" data-v-f55dccc0><h3 data-v-f55dccc0>2. physical profile</h3><ul data-v-f55dccc0><li data-v-f55dccc0><strong data-v-f55dccc0>Movement (M):</strong>The speed at which the operative moves across the killzone, represented by a distance value </li><li data-v-f55dccc0><strong data-v-f55dccc0>Action Point Limit (APL):</strong>The number of action points an operative generates when it is activated, which are used to perform actions. </li><li data-v-f55dccc0><strong data-v-f55dccc0>Group Activation (GA):</strong>Most operatives are activated individually, but some operatives must be activated in a group.
