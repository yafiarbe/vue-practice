The player controlling the target operative is the defender. </p><hr><h4>1. SELECT RANGED WEAPON</h4><p> The attacker selects one ranged weapon their operative is equipped with and collects their attack dice. Their attack dice are a number of D6 equal to the weapon’s Attacks characteristic. </p><h4>2. SELECT VALID TARGET</h4><p> The attacker selects a valid target for the shooting attack. A valid target is an enemy operative in the active operative’s Line of Sight that has no friendly operatives within its Engagement Range. If there are no valid targets for the shooting attack, the Shoot action cannot be resolved and you must choose a different action for the operative (the action points subtracted for the Shoot action would be refunded). If there are no valid targets for the shooting attack, the Shoot action cannot be resolved and you must choose a different action for the operative (the action points spent on the Shoot action would be refunded). </p><h4>3. ROLL ATTACK DICE</h4><p> The attacker rolls their attack dice. Each result that equals or beats the selected weapon’s Ballistic Skill characteristic is a successful hit and is retained. Each that doesn’t is a failed hit and is discarded. A result of 6 is always a successful hit and a result of 1 is always a failed hit. Keep track of each retained result of 6 - this is a critical hit. Each other retained success is a normal hit. </p><hr><p> Critical hits are well-placed or well-timed attacks. They often have unique effects, such as inflicting additional damage or being harder to defend against. This will be shown in the weapon’s Damage, Critical Hit Rules and any Special Rules it has. </p><h4>4. ROLL DEFENCE DICE</h4><p> The defender collects their defence dice and rolls them. Their defence dice are a number of D6 equal to the target’s Defence characteristic. Each result that equals or beats the target’s Save characteristic is a successful save and is retained. Each that doesn’t is a failed save and is discarded. A result of 1 is always a failed save. Keep track of each retained result of 6 - this is a critical save. Each other retained success is a normal save. </p><hr><p> Critical saves are well-timed dodges, esoteric protection or lucky escapes. They are used to avoid critical hits. </p><hr><p> If the target is in Cover, before rolling their defence dice, the defender can retain one as a successful normal save without rolling it. </p><hr><p> Some weapons have Special Rules that affect dice during an attack, such as Armour Penetration. Common Special Rules can be found here, and more unique ones will be found in the relevant army list. </p><h4>5. RESOLVE SUCCESSFUL SAVES</h4><p> The defender resolves all of their successful saves. To resolve a successful save, they select one or more of their retained defence dice, discard one of the attacker’s successful hits, then discard that defence dice. </p><ul><li> If the defence dice they select is a normal save, they select one of their opponent’s normal hits to be discarded. </li><li> If the defence dice they select are two normal saves, they select one of their opponent’s critical hits to be discarded. </li><li> If the defence dice they select is a critical save, they select one of their opponent’s normal hits or critical hits to be discarded. </li></ul><h4>6.

To resolve a successful hit, they select one of their retained attack dice, inflict damage on the target, then discard that attack dice. </p><ul><li> If the attack dice they select is a normal hit, inflict damage equal to the weapon’s Normal Damage. </li><li> If the attack dice they select is a critical hit, inflict damage equal to the weapon’s Critical Damage. </li></ul><h4>7.

Rolling a dice will give you a value, known as the result, which will determine the success or failure of your operatives’ deeds. Some rules refer to a D3. In such cases, roll one D6 and halve the value (rounding fractions up) to determine the result. </p><p data-v-d1e14f11> Many rules require a certain result to succeed, such as attacking. For example, to make a successful roll, you might need a 3+. This means the result must be three or higher to succeed, so a dice roll value of 3, 4, 5 or 6 succeeds, whereas a dice roll value of 1 or 2 fails. </p><p data-v-d1e14f11> Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll. You can never re-roll a dice more than once, and you cannot select the original result, even if the new result is worse. </p><p data-v-d1e14f11> Some rules instruct players to roll off. To do so, both players roll one D6, and whoever scores highest wins the roll-off. If there is a tie for the highest roll, make the roll-off again. If both players would use a rule that would allow them to re-roll their dice when rolling off, both players must declare the use of this rule before any dice are re-rolled, starting with the player who lost the roll off. </p><p data-v-d1e14f11> Some rare rules will modify the result of a roll by adding or subtracting from the result. All modifiers are cumulative. A dice result can be modified above or below the maximum or minimum possible value of the roll. For example, if a D6 value is 6 and you must add 1 to the result, the final result is a 7. </p></section>',2),ma={id:"datacards"},ga=d('<h2 data-v-d1e14f11>datacards</h2><p data-v-d1e14f11> Each operative in your Kill Team has its own set of individual rules known as a datacard.
